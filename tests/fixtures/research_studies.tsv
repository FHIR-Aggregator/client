phs000635.v1.p1	phs000635	ResearchStudy	completed	C0021400	U	Adult Influenza Vaccine Genetics	Prospective Longitudinal Cohort	"
This study includes two cohorts composed of healthy adults immunized with seasonal influenza vaccine. The first cohort was composed exclusively of males and second of females. Enrollment was restricted to individuals of European heritage to simplify the genetic analysis. Serum samples were collected prior to immunization and at 14 days and 28 days post immunization. Anti-hemagglutinin and neutralizing antibody activity was measured at each of the three time points for Influenza H1N1, H3N2, and Influenza B strains corresponding to the content of the vaccine. Peripheral blood RNA (PaxGene) were collected before immunization and on days 1, 3, and 14 post immunization. The RNA samples were analyzed using Illumina Human HT-12 v3 (Cohort 1) and Illumina HT-12 v4 beadarrays (Cohort 2).
