When looking for matches, there are 3 possible types of match: * a complete match - a code that represents all the provided properties correctly * a partial match - a code that represents some of the provided properties correctly, and not others  * a possible match - a code that may represent the provided properties closely, but may capture less or more precise information for some of the properties  The $find-matches operation can be called in one of 2 modes: * By a human, looking for the best match for a set of properties. In this mode, the server returns a list of complete, possible or partial matches (possibly with comments), so that the user can choose (or not) the most appropriate code * By a machine (typically in a system interface performing a transformation). In this mode, the server returns only a list of complete and partial matches, but no possible matches. The machine can choose a code from the list (or not) based on what properties are not coded  These modes are differentiated by the 'exact' parameter, so the client can indicate whether it only wants exact matches (including partial matches) or whether potential matches based on text matching are desired  The find-matches operation is still preliminary. The interface can be expected to change as more experience is gained from implementations.",

The server also returns whatever resources are needed to support the records - e.g. linked practitioners, locations, organizations etc. The principle intended use for this operation is to provide a patient with access to their record, or to allow a client to retrieve everything for an encounter for efficient display).

Servers should consider returning appropriate Provenance and AuditTrail on the returned resources, even though these are not directly part of the patient compartment.   It is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single encounter, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated encounter, if there is one, or can determine an appropriate list of encouners to provide data for from the context of the request.  If there is no nominated encounter (GET /Encounter/$everything) and the context is not associated with a single encounter record, the actual list of encounters is all encounters that the user associated with the request has access to. In such cases, the server may choose to return an error rather than all the records. Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and encounter records is outside the scope of this specification (though see [The Smart App Launch Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch).     When this operation is used to access multiple encounter records at once, the return bundle could be rather a lot of data; servers may choose to require that such requests are made [asynchronously](async.html), and associated with [bulk data formats](formats.html#bulk). Alternatively, clients may choose to page through the result set (or servers may require this). Paging through the results is done the same as for [Searching](http.html#paging), using the [_count](search.html#count) parameter, and Bundle links. Implementers should note that paging will be slower than simply returning all the results at once (more network traffic, multiple latency delays) but may be required in order not to exhaust available memory reading or writing the whole response in a single package. Unlike searching, there is no inherent user-display order for the $everything operation. Servers might consider sorting the returned resources in descending order of last record update, but are not required to do so. Servers should consider returning appropriate Provenance and AuditTrail on the returned resources, even though these are not directly part of the patient compartment.  The _since parameter is provided to support periodic queries to get additional information that has changed about the encounter since the last query. This means that the _since parameter is based on record time. The value of the _since parameter should be set to the time from the server. If using direct response, this is the timestamp in the response header. If using the async interface, this is the transaction timestamp in the json response. Servers should ensure that the timestamps a managed such that the client does not miss any changes. Clients should be able to handle getting the same response more than once in the case that the transaction falls on a time boundary.

    "description": "This operation is used to return all the information related to one or more products described in the resource or context on which this operation is invoked. The response is a bundle of type \"searchset\". At a minimum, the product resource(s) itself is returned, along with any other resources that the server has that are related to the products(s), and that are available for the given user. This is typically the marketing authorisations, ingredients, packages, therapeutic indications and so on. The server also returns whatever resources are needed to support the records - e.g. linked organizations, document references etc.",
    "code": "everything",
    "comment": "The key differences between this operation and simply performing a search and using _include and _revinclude are:      * unless the client requests otherwise, the server returns the entire result set in a single bundle (rather than using paging)   * the server is responsible for determining what resources to return as included resources (rather than the client specifying which ones).   This frees the client from needing to determine what it could or should ask for, particularly with regard to included resources. It also makes for a much shorter and easier to construct query string. Servers should consider returning appropriate Provenance and AuditTrail on the returned resources, even though these are not directly part of the product data.   When this operation is used to access multiple product records at once, the return bundle could be rather a lot of data; servers may choose to require that such requests are made [asynchronously](async.html), and associated with [bulk data formats](formats.html#bulk). Alternatively, clients may choose to page through the result set (or servers may require this). Paging through the results is done the same as for [Searching](http.html#paging), using the [_count](search.html#count) parameter, and Bundle links. Implementers should note that paging will be slower than simply returning all the results at once (more network traffic, multiple latency delays) but may be required in order not to exhaust available memory reading or writing the whole response in a single package. Unlike searching, there is no inherent user-display order for the $everything operation. Servers might consider sorting the returned resources in descending order of last record update, but are not required to do so.  The _since parameter is provided to support periodic queries to get additional information that has changed about the product since the last query. This means that the _since parameter is based on record time. The value of the _since parameter should be set to the time from the server. If using direct response, this is the timestamp in the response header. If using the async interface, this is the transaction timestamp in the json response. Servers should ensure that the timestamps a managed such that the client does not miss any changes. Clients should be able to handle getting the same response more than once in the case that the transaction falls on a time boundary. Clients should ensure that the other query parameters are constant to ensure a coherent set of records when doing periodic queries.",

If an application-level response is expected for the submitted message, that response SHALL be returned as the body of the 200 response. * **202 Accepted**: Indicates that the receiving system has accepted custody of the message * **204 No Content**: Indicates that the message has been fully processed and would normally have had an application-level response, but because of instructions from the sender (e.g. the [messageheader-response-request](extension-messageheader-response-request.html) extension), no response is being provided * **300+**: Indicates that the message was not successfully processed.  The server MAY return an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with additional information, and SHOULD do so if the response code is 400 or greater.<br/>  The client SHALL interpret a 4xx response to indicate that there is no point resubmitting the unaltered message, and a 5xx response to indicate an unexpected error occurred on the part of the server, with the implication that it may be appropriate to resubmit the original message. Doing so SHOULD NOT result in a duplicate message response. Repeated failures indicate either a fatal problem with the submission or a problem with the receiving application.  The following rules apply when using $process-message:  * The operation only accepts POST transactions - any other HTTP method will result in an HTTP error * The request content type submitted is always [Bundle](bundle.html) with type \"message\" containing a [Message Header](messageheader.html) resource as the first resource * The response content type returned is always [Bundle](bundle.html) with type \"message\" containing a [Message Header](messageheader.html) resource as the first resource, or an HTTP error * If the response is an error, the body SHOULD be an [Errors &mp; Warning](operationoutcome.html) resource with full details * The mailbox may be authenticated using standard HTTP authentication methods, including OAuth  The $process-message operation can be used by any HTTP end-point that accepts FHIR messages, not just FHIR RESTful servers.  In order to ensure consistency of processing, the [logical rules regarding processing of Bundle.id and message id](messaging.html#reliable) SHALL be followed when messages are processed using this operation.  The $process-message operation may be used synchronously, or asynchronously.  The following rules apply when using the $process-message operation synchronously:  * The URL (http://server/base/$process-message) has no parameters * It is an error if the sender POSTs a message that requires multiple response messages * Servers SHALL accept multiple concurrent message submissions and process them correctly (they are allowed to process them sequentially internally, but multiple concurrent submissions is not an error in its own right)  The following rules apply when using the $process-message operation asynchronously:  * The URL has at least one parameter: http://server/base/$process-message?async=true * The server acknowledges the message with a 200 OK with no body, or returns an HTTP error if the message cannot be processed * Accepting the message means that the server has understood the message enough to know where to respond * An [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) SHOULD be returned in either case * By default, the server responds by invoking the $process-message using the sender's stated end-point in the message: POST [MessageHeader.source.endpoint]/$process-messages] * Since the source end-point may be manipulated by message transfer engines, an alternative response address may be specified using the parameter \"response-url\": http://server/base/$process-message?async=true&amp;response-url=http://server2.com/base/anything.  The endpoint at the specified URL SHALL implement the signature of the $process-message operation (parameter async=true, accept a Bundle, return a 200 OK or an error) * The server submits response messages to the appropriate end-point with the parameter async=true.

    "description": "The *lastn query* meets the common need for searching for the most recent or last n=number of observations for a subject. For example, retrieving the last 5 temperatures for a patient to view trends or fetching the most recent laboratory results or vitals signs. To ask a server to return the last n=number of observations, the *lastn* query uses the [normal search parameters](observation.html#search) defined for the Observation resource.  However, rather than their normal use, they are interpreted as inputs - i.e.. instead of requiring that the resources literally contain the search parameters, they are passed to a server algorithm of some kind that uses them to determine the most appropriate matches.  The request for a lastn query SHALL include:  * A `$lastn` operation parameter *  A subject using either the `patient` or `subject`  search parameter *  A `category` parameter and/or a search parameter that contains a code element in its FHIRpath expression.

    "comment": "The key differences between this operation and simply searching the patient compartment are:      * unless the client requests otherwise, the server returns the entire result set in a single bundle (rather than using paging)   * the server is responsible for determining what resources to return as included resources (rather than the client specifying which ones).   This frees the client from needing to determine what it could or should ask for, particularly with regard to included resources. Servers should consider returning appropriate Provenance and AuditTrail on the returned resources, even though these are not directly part of the patient compartment.   It is assumed that the server has identified and secured the context appropriately, and can either associate the authorization context with a single patient, or determine whether the context has the rights to the nominated patient, if there is one, or can determine an appropriate list of patients to provide data for from the context of the request.   If there is no nominated patient (GET /Patient/$everything) and the context is not associated with a single patient record, the actual list of patients is all patients that the user associated with the request has access to. This may be all patients in the family that the patient has access to, or it may be all patients that a care provider has access to, or all patients on the entire record system. In such cases, the server may choose to return an error rather than all the records.  Specifying the relationship between the context, a user and patient records is outside the scope of this specification (though see [The Smart App Launch Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch).   When this operation is used to access multiple patient records at once, the return bundle could be rather a lot of data; servers may choose to require that such requests are made [asynchronously](async.html), and associated with [bulk data formats](formats.html#bulk). Alternatively, clients may choose to page through the result set (or servers may require this). Paging through the results is done the same as for [Searching](http.html#paging), using the [_count](search.html#count) parameter, and Bundle links. Implementers should note that paging will be slower than simply returning all the results at once (more network traffic, multiple latency delays) but may be required in order not to exhaust available memory reading or writing the whole response in a single package. Unlike searching, there is no inherent user-display order for the $everything operation. Servers might consider sorting the returned resources in descending order of last record update, but are not required to do so.  The _since parameter is provided to support periodic queries to get additional information that has changed about the patient since the last query. This means that the _since parameter is based on record time. The value of the _since parameter should be set to the time from the server. If using direct response, this is the timestamp in the response header. If using the async interface, this is the transaction timestamp in the json response. Servers should ensure that the timestamps a managed such that the client does not miss any changes. Clients should be able to handle getting the same response more than once in the case that the transaction falls on a time boundary. Clients should ensure that the other query parameters are constant to ensure a coherent set of records when doing periodic queries.",

    "description": "A Master Patient Index ([MPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_master_patient_index) ) is a service used to manage patient identification in a context where multiple patient databases exist. Healthcare applications and middleware use the MPI to match patients between the databases, and to store new patient details as they are encountered. MPIs are highly specialized applications, often tailored extensively to the institution's particular mix of patients. MPIs can also be run on a regional and national basis.    To ask an MPI to match a patient, clients use the \"$match\" operation, which accepts a patient resource which may be only partially complete. The data provided is interpreted as an MPI input and processed by an algorithm of some kind that uses the data to determine the most appropriate matches in the patient set.  Note that different MPI matching algorithms have different required inputs. The generic $match operation does not specify any particular algorithm, nor a minimum set of information that must be provided when asking for an MPI match operation to be performed, but many implementations will have a set of minimum information, which may be declared in their definition of the $match operation by specifying a profile on the resource parameter, indicating which properties are required in the search.  The patient resource submitted to the operation does not have to be complete, nor does it need to pass validation (i.e. mandatory fields don't need to be populated), but it does have to be a valid instance, as it is used as the reference data to match against.",

At the resource and historical entry level, the $meta operation returns the same meta as would be returned by accessing the resource directly. This can be used to allow a system to get access to the meta-information for the resource without accessing the resource itself, e.g. for security reasons",

    "code": "validate",
    "comment": "This operation may be used during design and development to validate application design. It can also be used at run-time. One possible use might be that a client asks the server whether a proposed update is valid as the user is editing a dialog and displays an updated error to the user. The operation can be used as part of a light-weight two phase commit protocol but there is no expectation that the server will hold the content of the resource after this operation is used, or that the server guarantees to successfully perform an actual create, update or delete after the validation operation completes.  This operation returns a 200 OK whether or not the resource is valid. A 4xx or 5xx error means that the validation itself could not be performed, and it is unknown whether the resource is valid or not.  Note: the correct behaviour of validation with regard to language (especially for Coding.display) is currently undefined, and further development and testing may lead to specific requirements or recommendations in subsequent releases  Future versions of this specifcation may add additional validation parameters.

    "comment": "The value set expansion returned by this query should be treated as a transient result that will change over time (whether it does or not depends on how the value set is specified), so applications should repeat the operation each time the value set is used.    If the expansion is too large (at the discretion of the server), the server MAY return an error (OperationOutcome with code too-costly). Clients can work through large flat expansions in a set of pages (partial views of the full expansion) instead of just getting the full expansion in a single exchange by using offset and count parameters, or use the count parameter to request a subset of the expansion for limited purposes. Servers are not obliged to support paging, but if they do, SHALL support both the offset and count parameters. Hierarchical expansions are not subject to paging and servers simply return the entire expansion.    Different servers may return different results from expanding a value set for the following reasons:    * The underlying code systems are different (e.g. different versions, possibly with different defined behavior)  * The server optimizes filter includes differently, such as sorting by code frequency  * Servers introduce arbitrary groups to assist a user to navigate the lists based either on extensions in the definition, or additional knowledge available to the server  When a server cannot correctly expand a value set because it does not fully understand the code systems (e.g. it has the wrong version, or incomplete definitions) then it SHALL return an error. If the value set itself is unbounded due to the inclusion of post-coordinated value sets (e.g. SNOMED CT, UCUM), then the extension [http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-unclosed](extension-valueset-unclosed.html) can be used to indicate that the expansion is incomplete",
